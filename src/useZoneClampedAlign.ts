// Wraps useAutoAlign with a zone-aware vertical decision for popovers that live inside a
// @tastic/split-screen zone (see useZoneBounds' own doc) — a no-op outside one (e.g. a solo,
// non-split-screen screen), where useAutoAlign's own decision is returned untouched.
//
// useAutoAlign picks above-vs-below and its own maxHeight by comparing room against the *full
// device window* — for a trigger inside a zone, that's wrong in a way a simple clamp on top can't
// fix: capping its chosen direction after the fact still leaves it capable of *choosing* the
// direction that points into the shared row (or the opposite player's own zone), which, once
// correctly capped at that boundary, often has hardly any room at all — nearly useless rather than
// merely mis-sized. The fix has to re-derive the whole vertical decision using the zone's real
// boundary instead of the window edge, preferring whichever real-world direction is actually safe
// (away from the shared row — that direction's room really is bounded by the screen edge, same as
// useAutoAlign already assumes) and only reaching toward the shared row when the content doesn't
// fit the safe side and the shared side genuinely has more room — the same "only flips when
// genuinely better" bias useAutoAlign itself uses, just comparing against the zone's own boundary
// instead of the opposite screen edge.
//
// One more twist specific to p2's 180°-rotated zone: PopoverBody positions itself with plain
// relative CSS (`top:'100%'`/`bottom:'100%'`) against its trigger, resolved in *local*
// (pre-rotation) space and then rotated along with everything else in the zone — which inverts it,
// local 'below' the trigger paints as real-world *above* it once the whole zone flips 180°, and
// vice versa. This hook's result has to be flipped back to the *local* label PopoverBody expects
// whenever the zone itself is rotated (zone.rotated), or it ends up choosing the real-world
// direction it meant to avoid — which is exactly the bug an earlier version of this hook had for
// p2 specifically (it worked correctly for p1, which isn't rotated, and that's what made the bug
// easy to miss during testing).
//
// CORRECTION (2026-09-18): the paragraph above used to also claim "this hook's own direction math
// is all real-world (from measureInWindow, which — unlike onLayout — already resolves
// post-transform)" — that's the exact claim useAutoAlign.ts's own doc documents as having already
// shipped one real, unnoticed bug once (measureInWindow reports the PRE-transform frame, not
// post-transform; see that file's own comment). This hook still doesn't apply useAutoAlign's own
// rotateRect(...) correction to its raw measureInWindow read below (awayRoom/towardRoom are
// computed straight from the uncorrected y/height) — that's a real, currently-unfixed gap, left
// alone deliberately rather than guessed at: DualZoneLayout's own sharedEdgeY (see
// React-Native-Split-Screen's DualZoneLayout.tsx, measureShared) has the identical uncorrected-
// measureInWindow gap, since sharedRef sits under the same live-rotating outer FakeLandscapeView
// every real caller wraps this in — and zone.rotated alone isn't sufficient to fix just this
// hook's own half of it (it captures a trigger's own net rotation for p1/p2 specifically, which
// happens to fully account for the outer rotation there, but sharedEdgeY's own correction needs
// the outer rotation directly, which differs from zone.rotated for whichever seat zone.rotated is
// currently true for). Correcting one side without the other risks making the comparison *more*
// wrong, not less. No current caller in the fleet actually exercises this path today — every real
// cpuDifficultyAlignOverride call site across the fleet is a confirmed no-op, never actually
// rendering inside a live DualZoneLayout zone — so nothing currently miscalculates in practice, but
// this needs real rotated-zone test coverage (ideally live device testing, not just a unit test
// stubbing measureInWindow) before either hook's room-size/direction math under live device
// rotation is trustworthy.
//
// `rotation` IS threaded through below, though — that part's unambiguous and low-risk on its own:
// it only ever reaches useAutoAlign's own (rotation-aware) horizontal align decision, which is
// exactly what a caller gets back verbatim via the `if (!zone) return auto` fallback whenever this
// hook is used outside a zone at all (its own documented "safe to reach for even in a component
// that might or might not end up inside one" case) — matching every sibling rotation-aware
// component's own default of an ambient `useRotation()` read when the caller omits it.
//
// The "away" direction's own room also has to stop at the physical safe area, not the raw window
// edge — useAutoAlign's own windowHeight is the full device height, notch/status bar and home
// indicator included, so left alone this hook's fix for the shared-row boundary would just trade
// one overflow (into the other zone) for another (under the status bar, or behind the home
// indicator). The toward-shared direction doesn't need this: sharedEdgeY already sits well inside
// the safe content area on its own.
